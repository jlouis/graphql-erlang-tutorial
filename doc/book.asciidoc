{project} Tutorial

The guide here is a running example of the "Star Wars" API implemented
in Erlang through the Shopgun GraphQL engine. The intent is to provide
readers with enough information they can go build their own GraphQL
servers in Erlang.

The GraphQL system is used by https://shopgun.com as a data backend.
They also sponsored this tutorial as part of their Open Source efforts.
