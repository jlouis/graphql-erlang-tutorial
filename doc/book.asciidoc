Erlang GraphQL Tutorial

The guide here is a running example of the "Star Wars" API implemented
in Erlang through the Shopgun GraphQL engine. The intent is to provide
readers with enough information they can go build their own GraphQL
servers in Erlang.

The GraphQL is used by https://shopgun.com as a data backend. All the
work here has been done as part of the Shopgun implementation, and
they sponsored all the work that has been done.
